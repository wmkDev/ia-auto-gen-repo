Training Process and Sources for ChatGPT
ChatGPT has undergone a rigorous training process to develop its conversational abilities. Here are some details about the training process and the sources used:

Initial Training: The initial training data for ChatGPT consisted of conversations where humans played both sides - as a user of the AI-chatbot and as the AI-chatbot itself. This dialogue format allowed the model to understand and respond to various conversational scenarios. [3]
Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback: After the initial training, the model was fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Real humans provided conversations and ranked the model's responses based on their quality. This iterative process helped improve the model's conversational capabilities, allowing it to answer follow-up questions, admit mistakes, and challenge incorrect premises. [3]
Training Data: The training data used for ChatGPT initially included a massive volume of sample text from web pages and program code, collected before the end of 2021. This data provided the model with a broad understanding of language and programming concepts. Additionally, conversations provided by real humans during the RLHF process were used to fine-tune the model's responses. [14]
Architecture: ChatGPT follows a similar architecture to the original GPT models, which is based on the transformer architecture. It uses a transformer decoder block with a self-attention mechanism. The model has 96 attention blocks, each containing 96 attention heads, with a total of 175 billion parameters. This architecture allows ChatGPT to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. [12]
Managing Data: OpenAI has introduced new features to allow users to manage their data in ChatGPT. Users can now choose to turn off chat history, giving them control over which conversations can be used to train the models. This feature enhances privacy and allows users to customize their training data. [13]
These sources provide insights into the training process and the underlying architecture of ChatGPT. The training data consists of a combination of web text, program code, and conversations provided by real humans. The model has been fine-tuned using reinforcement learning techniques, enabling it to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses in conversations.
