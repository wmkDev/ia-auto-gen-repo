Reinforcement learning with human feedback is a machine learning technique that combines the power of reinforcement learning algorithms with the knowledge and guidance provided by human feedback. This approach aims to improve the learning process by leveraging the expertise and insights of human evaluators. By incorporating human feedback, reinforcement learning models can achieve better performance and accelerate the learning process. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of reinforcement learning with human feedback, including its applications, challenges, and future directions.
