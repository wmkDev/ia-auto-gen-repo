Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback is an approach that combines the power of reinforcement learning algorithms with the human expertise to enhance the learning process. This technique is useful when the reward signal is sparse or difficult to define directly. By involving humans in the loop, the learning process becomes more efficient and effective.
