Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback is a machine learning technique that combines the use of reinforcement learning algorithms with human input or feedback to guide and improve the learning process. It involves training an AI agent to learn from a combination of its own experiences and the feedback provided by human experts. The human feedback can be in the form of rewards, evaluations, or direct guidance, depending on the specific application. By incorporating human feedback, reinforcement learning with human feedback aims to enhance the learning efficiency, address the exploration-exploitation dilemma, and achieve better performance in complex tasks.
