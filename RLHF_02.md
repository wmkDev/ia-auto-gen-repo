Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback combines the principles of reinforcement learning with human input to create an interactive learning process. It involves an agent that learns how to perform tasks by receiving feedback from human teachers. The agent uses this feedback to improve its decision-making and performance over time. This approach addresses the challenge of training complex AI systems by leveraging the expertise and guidance of human teachers.
