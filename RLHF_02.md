Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where a computer learns or makes decisions based on trial and error. It learns by getting feedback from humans, who tell it if it's doing things right or wrong. This is like when you're learning to ride a bike and your parents give you feedback on how to balance or pedal. The computer uses this feedback to improve its decision-making and become better at whatever task it's learning. So, reinforcement learning with human feedback helps computers learn faster and make smarter decisions!
