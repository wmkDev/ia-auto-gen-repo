Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback from human trainers. The human trainers provide feedback in the form of evaluations or preferences to guide the learning process. It combines the benefits of reinforcement learning, which uses reward signals to learn, with the ability of human trainers to provide more nuanced and domain-specific guidance. This approach is particularly useful in domains where it is difficult to design an appropriate reward function or where there are ethical considerations involved. The agent learns from both the human feedback and its own exploration, gradually improving its performance over time.
