The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence where each number is the sum of the preceding two numbers. Assuming the first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1, the 50th number in the Fibonacci sequence can be determined. Applying the rule, we can calculate the sequence up to the 50th number.
