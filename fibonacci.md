The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers. Assuming the first two numbers are 0 and 1, the 50th number in the Fibonacci sequence can be found using the following formula:

```
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```

To find the 50th number, we need to calculate all the preceding numbers. Here's the calculation for the first few numbers in the sequence:

```
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 0 + 1 = 1
F(3) = 1 + 1 = 2
F(4) = 1 + 2 = 3
F(5) = 2 + 3 = 5
F(6) = 3 + 5 = 8
...
```

Continuing this pattern, we can calculate the 50th number in the sequence.
