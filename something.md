The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is equal to the sum of the two preceding numbers. It starts with 0 and 1, so the third number is 1 (0 + 1 = 1), the fourth number is 2 (1 + 1 = 2), and so on. To find the 50th number in the Fibonacci sequence, we can start by listing out the first few numbers:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
```

Continuing this pattern, we would need to find the sum of the 48th and 49th numbers to get the 50th number. However, manually calculating each of these numbers can be time-consuming. Instead, we can use the formula for finding the nth Fibonacci number, which is:

```
Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```

Applying this formula, we can quickly determine the 50th number in the Fibonacci sequence.
